          <p id="statement-one">
            I'm someone who loves spending time with friends, especially when 
            we're playing video games together. Music and movies are my go-to 
            for relaxation and entertainment. On top of that, I've started to 
            dive into the world of coding. Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, 
            and React has become my new adventure. I'm passionate about creating 
            and exploring the possibilities in web development, even as a 
            newcomer to the field.
          </p>

            Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a soft spot for dad jokes. 
            Their simplicity and humor always manage to brighten my day. It's 
            this combination of tech exploration and enjoying life's lighter 
            moments that makes my journey unique. Balancing the challenges of 
            coding with the joy of shared laughter and good times with friends 
            is what keeps me motivated and excited about the future.
